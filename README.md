## Rules
* You are a little spaceman who is building up a series of buildings on the new planet youâ€™re trying to settle. But there are a series of natural disasters that get in your way. You need to survive each natural disaster by completing certain objectives. A flood is coming? Make sure you build a tower tall enough to keep yourself safe from drowning. A snowstorm is about to hit? Make sure your building is thick enough to keep the heat in. As you progress, you will need to build multiple buildings, solving multiple challenges at once, in order to complete the new settlement!
